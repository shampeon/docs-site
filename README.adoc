== Antora playbook

An {url-docs-playbook}[Antora playbook] is responsible for generating a documentation site.
It contains the instructions a user wants to relay to the Antora site generator.
These instructions include the content Antora should collect and the {url-ui}[UI] it should apply to the generated site.

The file [.path]`antora-playbook.yml` in this repository is the playbook used to produce the demo site.
